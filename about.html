                    <p>We the avid lovers of the Hakka tradition at LeiPoPo are thankful that you would join us for this short story session. <br><br>
                    This story begins after we left our home in Malaysia and begin life anew in Singapore. It was during this 10 year time that we realised it was really difficult to find the Leicha that mother used to cook back home. And so, we decided to experiment with different ways of cooking Leicha in order to find that taste yet again.<br></r><br>
                    Our goal in the beginning was just to share this flavour with our friends and family and never thought more of it, certainly not to start a business. However after hearing the praises given and encouragements, we eventually decided to take a leap of faith and start Hakka Leipopo.<br><br>
                    We sincerely thank you everyone for the support shown so far, and promise to continue upholding our quality and wishes that everyone can reminisce about the traditional flavours after having a taste of our Leicha.
